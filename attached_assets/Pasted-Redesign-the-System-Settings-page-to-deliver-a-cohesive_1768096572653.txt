Redesign the System Settings page to deliver a cohesive, scalable, and department-specific configuration experience with the following enhancements:

1. **Responsive Architecture**:
   - Implement a fluid grid system with CSS Flexbox/Grid and media queries to ensure optimal scaling across all screen sizes (mobile to 4K).
   - Replace fixed-width containers with percentage-based or `minmax()` constraints for dynamic resizing.
   - Introduce a collapsible sidebar that transitions to a bottom navigation bar on smaller screens, preserving accessibility and functionality.

2. **Unified Navigation & Information Hierarchy**:
   - Restructure the sidebar into a logical, nested taxonomy where primary categories (e.g., Helpdesk, User Management) expand to reveal subcategories (Ticket Settings, SLA Policies) with clear visual grouping.
   - Eliminate redundant top-header toggles by consolidating all related settings under their respective sidebar sections, ensuring one-click access to any configuration.
   - Enforce a "single source of truth" principle: each setting must appear in only one location, with contextual breadcrumbs for navigation clarity.

3. **Department-Specific Configuration**:
   - Overhaul the Helpdesk section to support department-level customization, with a dropdown selector at the top of the section to switch contexts (e.g., IT, HR, Finance).
   - Dynamically filter and display settings relevant to the selected department, with visual indicators (e.g., badges, color-coding) to denote department-specific overrides.
   - Implement a permission-aware UI that grays out or hides settings based on the user’s departmental access rights.

4. **Visual & Interaction Refinements**:
   - Apply a consistent design language with elevated card-based layouts, subtle shadows, and rounded corners for modern aesthetics.
   - Introduce smooth transitions (e.g., fade-in/out, slide animations) when switching between sections or departments to maintain spatial awareness.
   - Enhance form controls with inline validation, tooltips for complex fields, and a "changes pending" indicator to prevent accidental navigation away from unsaved edits.

5. **Technical & Performance Optimizations**:
   - Replace client-side rendering bottlenecks with virtualized lists for long scrollable sections (e.g., SLA policies, user roles).
   - Implement lazy-loading for non-critical sections and preload high-priority assets to reduce perceived latency.
   - Ensure all interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader compatibility.

6. **Micro-Interactions & User Feedback**:
   - Add hover states, active states, and loading spinners for all interactive elements to improve perceived responsiveness.
   - Include a non-intrusive toast notification system to confirm successful saves or alert to errors without disrupting workflow.
   - Integrate a "guided tour" mode for first-time users, highlighting key sections with optional tooltips.

7. **Backend & State Management**:
   - Refactor the data fetching layer to use React Query or SWR for efficient caching, background updates, and optimistic UI updates.
   - Centralize settings state in a context/redux store to avoid prop drilling and ensure consistency across nested components.
   - Implement debounced API calls for search/filter inputs to reduce server load.
